# Typhoon Claw Robot
In light of the Design Thinking process and hands-on experiences that are critical in shaping studentsâ€™ project learning, critical thinking, and team building skills, the Typhoon Claw Robotics Team designed, programmed and built the Typhoon Claw Robot for the 2017-2018 Asia Open VEX Robotics Competition. Typhoon Claw Robot is incorporated a collapsible platform, scissor lift, expandable arm, continuous tracks, and a main claw. Controlled by a joystick, the Robot can pick up objects in a wide height range.
